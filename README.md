# My Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! 👋 My name is Anuja Dixit , and this is a showcase of my work as a front-end developer. In this portfolio, I’ve created a visually appealing and responsive webpage using HTML and CSS to demonstrate my skills and provide insight into my work.


🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML: Semantic and well-structured HTML to create the basic layout of the portfolio.
- CSS: Utilized modern CSS techniques, including Flexbox and Grid for layout, as well as custom styles for visual appeal.
- Responsive Design: Ensured the portfolio looks great on all screen sizes using media queries.
