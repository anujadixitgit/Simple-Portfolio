    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Anuja Dixit, a Full Stack Web Developer currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Applications (MCA) from Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology. With a passion for coding and building scalable web applications, I specialize in both front-end and back-end development, crafting seamless user experiences and robust server-side solutions.

        My journey as a web developer has allowed me to work with a range of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as modern frameworks like React, Node.js, and Express. I am also comfortable working with databases like MongoDB and MySQL, ensuring that applications I build are not only interactive but also data-efficient and secure.

        As a problem-solver, I’m always eager to learn new technologies and tools, and I take pride in keeping up with the latest trends in web development. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and continuously refining my skills through personal projects and real-world experiences.
        
        Outside of coding, I enjoy Photography. If you’d like to collaborate on a project or just discuss tech, feel free to connect!</p>
